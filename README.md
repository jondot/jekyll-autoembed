# Jekyll::Autoembed

It autoembeds gists for now (like Medium does).

## Quick Start

```
gem install jekyll-autoembed
```

Add `jekyll-autoembed` to your Jekyll project `Gemfile` and to your `_config.yml` in plugins.

Then anywhere there is a bare `gist` link, you'll get an embedded gist. See the [specs](spec/jekyll) for examples.
